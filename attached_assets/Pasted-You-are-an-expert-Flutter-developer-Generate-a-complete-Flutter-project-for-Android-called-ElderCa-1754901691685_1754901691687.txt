You are an expert Flutter developer. Generate a complete Flutter project for Android called "ElderCare Alert" with these features:

1. **Fall Detection**:
   - Use `sensors_plus` to read accelerometer data.
   - If the total acceleration magnitude exceeds 15 m/sÂ², trigger a fall alert.

2. **Heart Rate Monitoring**:
   - Use `flutter_blue_plus` to connect to a Bluetooth heart rate monitor.
   - Show live heart rate on the home screen.
   - If heart rate < 50 bpm or > 120 bpm, trigger an alert.

3. **Twilio SMS Alerts**:
   - Use `twilio_flutter` to send an SMS to a saved caregiver number.
   - SMS should include:
     - Type of alert (Fall or Abnormal Heart Rate)
     - GPS location from the `location` package
     - Date and time of the alert.

4. **Caregiver Settings**:
   - Settings screen to save caregiver phone number in `shared_preferences`.
   - Option to test SMS sending.

5. **Alert History**:
   - Store past alerts (type, date/time, location) using `hive` for local storage.
   - Display in a history screen using a ListView.

6. **UI Requirements**:
   - Large buttons and text for elderly accessibility.
   - Home screen must show:
     - Live heart rate
     - Fall detection status
     - Big red SOS button to send a manual alert.

7. **Folder Structure**:
   - lib/screens/
     - home_screen.dart
     - settings_screen.dart
     - history_screen.dart
   - lib/services/
     - fall_detection_service.dart
     - heart_rate_service.dart
     - sms_service.dart
     - location_service.dart
   - lib/models/
     - alert_model.dart
   - main.dart

**Additional Requirements**:
- Use Dart null safety.
- Include comments for key functions.
- Use dummy Twilio credentials and simulated heart rate if no device is connected.
- Add all dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` so the app runs after `flutter pub get`.
- Code must be complete, so that when I click "Run" in Replit or download the ZIP and run it locally, the app works without syntax errors.
